// Three columns, as designed. The rail chooses what the middle panel shows;
// the chart holds the right-hand side and never goes away, because the answer
// to "why is this trade open" is always on it. Closing the middle panel (✕)
// gives the chart the whole screen — the panel is a companion to the chart,
// not a page that replaces it.
//
// Sections the design calls for and we do not have yet (Scora, Backtests,
// Alerts) say so plainly rather than showing an empty panel that looks broken.

 *   them in. Buildable today.
 *
 *   Support / resistance — the data does not exist here. The bot computes

 *   nothing persists them: no column in bot_market_state, no table of its own.
 *   The browser has nothing to read.
