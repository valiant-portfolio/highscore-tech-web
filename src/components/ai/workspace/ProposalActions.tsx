// This used to be a pair of buttons on the Telegram alert. It is not any more,
// and the reason is the whole point: a tap in a chat is attributable to a chat
// account at best, and shared phones and forwarded messages make even that
// soft. "Who approved this trade" has to be answerable by name weeks later, so
// the answer is given where there is a signed-in session behind it —
// decideProposalAction stamps decided_by with the account that clicked.
//
// It also shows the one thing that can kill a setup while it waits, BEFORE
// the button rather than as a failure afterwards: the shelf life. Twelve bars
// from the signal bar, and the bot marks it missed even if someone then says
// yes. Being told "too late" after pressing approve is what makes people stop
// trusting the flow.
//
// What it does NOT do is judge where price is relative to the level. A limit
// rests where price has not got to YET; that price traded there at some point
// in the past is how the level was found in the first place, not a fault. The
// distance is stated and the decision is left to the person making it.
